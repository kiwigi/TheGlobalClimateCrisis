# The Global Climate Crisis

Simple responsive website made using React, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 

## Purpose

This website was made for a "poster" group project in a geography class. The website was made entirely by me in an attempt to learn how to use React.

## Graphics

The graphic used for the website was drawn by me, then animated inside Adobe After Effects and converted into a Json object using Bodymovin.
